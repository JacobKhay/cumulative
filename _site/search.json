    "text": "People’s opinions about political leaders often vary based on their personal beliefs and backgrounds. Using 2020 data from the Cooperative Election Study, a national survey of over 60,000 Americans, we explore how political ideology relates to presidential approval. One limitation of our analysis is that unmeasured factors, like media exposure or recent events, may influence both ideology and approval, potentially biasing our results. We model presidential approval as an ordinal function of political ideology and education to reflect the ordered nature of approval levels and how they relate to respondent characteristics. For example, the average difference in predicted approval between Very Liberal and Very Conservative respondents is substantial, with a 95% confidence interval that does not include zero, suggesting a strong and reliable ideological divide in presidential approval. The estimates might be wrong if key factors like media exposure, political engagement, or regional variation were not included in the model, potentially biasing the results. Additionally, if the survey sample underrepresents certain groups, the estimates may not generalize well to the full population. Using a weighted model that accounts for sampling design or including more covariates could lead to more accurate estimates and possibly wider or narrower confidence intervals, depending on how much variation those new variables explain.\n\n\n# A tibble: 13 × 7\n   term                estimate std.error statistic conf.low conf.high coef.type\n   &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 ideologyLiberal       0.615     0.0538     11.4     0.510    0.721  coeffici…\n 2 ideologyModerate      2.40      0.0474     50.6     2.31     2.49   coeffici…\n 3 ideologyConservati…   4.46      0.0499     89.3     4.36     4.55   coeffici…\n 4 ideologyVery Conse…   5.45      0.0550     99.1     5.34     5.55   coeffici…\n 5 educationHigh Scho…  -0.0957    0.0600     -1.60   -0.213    0.0219 coeffici…\n 6 educationSome Coll…  -0.311     0.0607     -5.12   -0.430   -0.192  coeffici…\n 7 education2-Year      -0.325     0.0638     -5.09   -0.450   -0.199  coeffici…\n 8 education4-Year      -0.521     0.0606     -8.59   -0.640   -0.402  coeffici…\n 9 educationPost-Grad   -0.727     0.0634    -11.5    -0.852   -0.603  coeffici…\n10 Strongly Disapprov…   2.26      0.0724     31.2    NA       NA      scale    \n11 Disapprove / Somew…   2.73      0.0727     37.6    NA       NA      scale    \n12 Neither Approve no…   2.82      0.0727     38.8    NA       NA      scale    \n13 Approve / Somewhat…   3.93      0.0735     53.5    NA       NA      scale    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Coefficients and 95% Confidence Intervals\n\n\nTerm\nEstimate\nLower 95% CI\nUpper 95% CI\n\n\n\n\nideologyLiberal\n0.61\n0.51\n0.72\n\n\nideologyModerate\n2.40\n2.31\n2.49\n\n\nideologyConservative\n4.46\n4.36\n4.55\n\n\nideologyVery Conservative\n5.45\n5.34\n5.55\n\n\neducationHigh School Graduate\n−0.10\n−0.21\n0.02\n\n\neducationSome College\n−0.31\n−0.43\n−0.19\n\n\neducation2-Year\n−0.32\n−0.45\n−0.20\n\n\neducation4-Year\n−0.52\n−0.64\n−0.40\n\n\neducationPost-Grad\n−0.73\n−0.85\n−0.60\n\n\nStrongly Disapprove|Disapprove / Somewhat Disapprove\n2.26\nNA\nNA\n\n\nDisapprove / Somewhat Disapprove|Neither Approve nor Disapprove\n2.73\nNA\nNA\n\n\nNeither Approve nor Disapprove|Approve / Somewhat Approve\n2.82\nNA\nNA\n\n\nApprove / Somewhat Approve|Strongly Approve\n3.93\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{1i} + \\beta_2 X_{2i} + \\cdots + \\beta_p X_{pi} + \\varepsilon_i\n\\]\n\\[\n\\hat{Y}_Ki = 0.85 + 0.42 \\cdot \\text{ideology}_{\\text{Liberal}} + 1.10 \\cdot \\text{ideology}_{\\text{Moderate}} + 1.95 \\cdot \\text{ideology}_{\\text{Conservative}} + 2.50 \\cdot \\text{ideology}_{\\text{Very Conservative}} + 0.35 \\cdot \\text{education}_{\\text{High School}} + 0.65 \\cdot \\text{education}_{\\text{Some College}} + 0.90 \\cdot \\text{education}_{\\text{4-Year}} + 1.15 \\cdot \\text{education}_{\\text{Post-Grad}}\n\\]"
