People's opinions about political leaders often vary based on their personal beliefs and backgrounds. Using 2020 data from the Cooperative Election Study, a national survey of over 60,000 Americans, we explore how political ideology relates to presidential approval.

```{r}
#| message: false 
library(tidyverse)
library(primer.data)
```


```{r}
x <- ces |> filter(year == 2020) |> select(approval, education, ideology) |> drop_na() |> slice_sample(n = 2000)

x
```


```{r}
x |> ggplot(aes(x = ideology, fill = approval)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(
    title = "Presidential Approval by Political Ideology",
    subtitle = "Based on 2,000 CES respondents from 2020",
    x = "Ideology",
    y = "Count of Respondents",
    fill = "Approval Level",
    caption = "Source: Cooperative Election Study (2020)"
  )

```
